                    <p>
                        I'm a game developer studying GIMM (Gaming Interactive Media and Mobile Technology) at Boise State University. I love all aspects of game design, from coding and conceptualizing to rigging and animating. I enjoy bringing my artistic creativity to life through technology in new and fascinating ways and I hope to help build the future of mixed reality and spatial computing.

                       This is a series of digital low poly portraits of personal friends of mine which were shot with an IPhone 7 and edited using Photoshop. One very interesting part of this project for me was coming to the realization that color can incredibly effectively be used to show or imply structure within an art piece. 
                       My low poly portrait "Unicorn Dreams" was recently put on exhibit on Boise State Universities' campus as part of an on campus art competition.
