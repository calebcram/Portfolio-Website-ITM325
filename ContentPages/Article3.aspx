        <h2>NASA SUITS Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                          The Augmented Reality Space Informatics System (ARSIS) was designed for the NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interfaces for Students) challenge as a prototype for an augmented reality (AR) head-mounted device (HMD) interface to be integrated into astronauts’ helmets. During extravehicular activity (EVA) missions, it is important to be able to communicate complex data and instructions to crew members. By showing this information in astronauts’ physical space instead of on a traditional monitor, information can be communicated in a more direct, natural manner. ARSIS has a dual purpose of increasing astronaut autonomy and efficiency of communication with Mission Control. It includes the ability to anchor instructions, three methods of user input, 3D telestration with Mission Control, translational maps, lighting adaptation, and object recognition.

        <h2>Imation Mundos</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is my Senior Capstone VR storytelling experience built for my bachelors in GIMM. This story is meant to show the possible impliactions of quantum superpostion and what collapsing in and out of superposition could be like.

        <h2>Grocery VR Simulator</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a vr grocery game being developed as part of my senior capstone in GIMM for the Boise School District to help teach special needs children how to live, budget, plan and interact in a social grocery store setting.

        <h2>PipAR</h2>
                    <p>
                          Developed for Invent For the Planet 2020: PipAR is an Augmented Reality GIS mapping/tracking application that I developed in 48 hours using Unity and Vuforia for Invent For The Planet 2020. The goal of PipAR is to streamline GIS utility tracking by displaying it in an easy to understand 3D format allowing for quick and efficient transcription by industry specialists.

        <h2>MazeAR</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is an Augmented Reality maze game I am developing that uses an image tracking target as the "floor" of a maze that can be moved around to help a ball traverse through it to the end.

        <h2>ConstructAR</h2>
                    <p>
                        Developed for construction inspections as part of my Mobile Web Development class

        <h2>VR Gesture Tracking</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a prototype I'm currently working on with the ultimate intention of improving my VR spellcasting game. In its current form, the software displays a military physical command signal on a UI canvas in front of the player. The player then mimics the command, if it is not close enough, the UI will display that their attempt was incorrect, but if they get it correct, the UI will move on to the next hand signal until all signal are successfully completed at which point the player can make whatever signal they want which the software will recognize and match to its list of signals.

        <h2>Multiplayer VR Toolkit</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is an ongoing collaborative project in which I built a cross platform, multiplayer VR lobby system along with a series of multiplayer VR minigames that can fluidly be switched between while in VR. As time goes on, more minigames and features will be added to the game. Testing was performed with a first generation HTC Vive, an Oculus Rift S and an Oculus Quest 2.

        <h2>Space Bubble AR</h2>
                    <p>
                        Developed for the Boise School District for children on the autistic spectrum as part of my Mobile Application Development Class. 
                        This is an Augmented Reality prototype we are developing as part of a series of prototypes to help improve the education of children with special needs using technology. Specifically, this prototype is built to teach children on the autistic spectrum what spatial awareness is and how to understand it.

        <h2>Virtual School Bus</h2>
                    <p>
                        Developed for Invent For the Planet 2019
                        Our challenge was to conceptualize and prototype an application of Virtual Reality to benefit the community within a 48 hr time period. Ultimately we settled on a Virtual Reality language learning game that would strive to fully immerse the player in the world of the language they are trying to learn helping them form stronger mental connections with what they are saying/hearing. 
                        We used Oculus OVR plugin with Unity to create a VR recreation of a Japanese city that the player needs to traverse by speaking Japanese with NPC's. This forces the player to speak conversationally and think more reactivley as opposed to following scripted conversations and responses. The ultimate goal of this is a more efficient and effective learning experience.
                        Ultimately we didn't get the language translation to be fully functional due to lack of time, but we got a simple prototype working and managed to take second place in the competition.

        <h2>OVERSLEPT!</h2>
                    <p>
                        You wake up from a dream only to realize you are running late for work (Work is interchangeable with other things like school, date, presentation, competition etc). You climb out of bed and run to your bathroom to freshen up. After you’re clean, you run to the closet to get dressed glancing at your calendar and grab your wallet along the way. Next, you race to the kitchen and decide what to do for lunch. You end up slapping together a sandwich and running for the door, grabbing your keys, briefcase and flash drive. You get in your car, but the battery is dead. You can either try to jumpstart it, catch the bus or ride your bike. You then navigate challenges on your way to work and pick what kind of music you’d like to listen to on the ride. You then reach one of three possible final endings based on your decisions. You either make it to work on time and your boss is happy with your performance, or you show up to work late and get fired. Lastly, if you manage to bungle every choice possible, you may never actually make it to work. 
                        This a VR project I am developing as part of a series of classes in my GIMM degree.
